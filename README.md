🌸 Iris Dataset Classification using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
This project demonstrates a complete workflow for performing classification using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm on the popular Iris dataset. It covers data preprocessing, model training, performance evaluation, and visualizing decision boundaries.

📌 Project Highlights
✅ Loaded and preprocessed the Iris dataset (used 2 features for 2D visualization)
⚖️ Normalized features using StandardScaler
🤖 Trained multiple KNN models with different values of K
📊 Evaluated accuracy and confusion matrix
🧠 Visualized decision boundaries to understand model performance

📊 Sample Outputs
Accuracy Scores for different K values
Confusion Matrix for performance evaluation
Decision Boundary Plot for 2D feature separation

📉 Evaluation Metrics Used
Accuracy Score
Confusion Matrix
Visual Decision Region Boundaries

Tools: scikit-learn, matplotlib, numpy

🧠 Further Improvements
Add interactive dashboard using Streamlit

Include all 4 features with dimensionality reduction (e.g., PCA)

Try other classifiers like SVM, Logistic Regression, etc.
